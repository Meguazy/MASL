# The role of Levodopa and Carbidopa in Parkinson's disease using Repast4Py: A simulation approach

This is the GitHub repository for the project of Francesco Finucci for the exam of MultiAgent Systems Lab by Prof. Emanuela Merelli and Prof. Stefano Maestri at the university of Camerino.

The goal of this project was to create a MAS simulator using Repast4Py that is able to replicate a certain aspect of Parkinson's disease in a multi-environment setting. My choice was to study the role of two medicines called **levodopa** and **carbidopa** and how the communication between the Substantia Nigra (the region of the brain in which Parkinson develops) and the peripheral immune system works in 3 different conditions:
- Without levodopa and without carbidopa;
- With levodopa but without carbidopa;
- With both levodopa and carbidopa.
